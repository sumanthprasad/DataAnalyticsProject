In this analysis, an attempt has been made to figure out the most important parameter which contributes positively to making a decision of giving out a loan or not. Needless to say, this is a problem of binary classification.
Below algorithms have been used while doing the analysis.
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest
The data of the data frames have been analyzed using python libraries i.e. pandas,numpy,matplotlib, seaborn and scikit learn.
